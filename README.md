# Text-adventure-game

This project is based on the 1980s text adventure game, Zork. The base code is being put together with the support of a video series on youtube. This is part 1:

This site uses Javascript and jQuery to achieve the interactive elements. By making this, I hope to not only have a super-fun text adventure programme that people can play (my earliest programming efforts in my childhood were text adventure games, so this very much feels like coming full circle) but also to have a playground in which to practice jQuery.

My hope is that, once the initial code is in place, I will be able to make this project my own not only by visual styling using CSS and additional html elements, but also by putting in place additional functionality to the game system, such as combat and use of items.
